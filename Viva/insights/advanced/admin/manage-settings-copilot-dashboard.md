# Manage settings for the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard 

>[!Note]
>This feature is rolling out gradually to all customers with more than 50 Copilot assigned licenses.

As an admin, you can configure several features of the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard. With these settings, for example, you can control who can access the dashboard, upload organizational data, create an exclusion list, upload aggregated survey data, and set the minimum group size for generating insights. Let's review them.

## Manage access for individual users and groups

These steps must be performed by the Microsoft 365 Global Administrator.

>[!Note]
>When you add or remove users to the dashboard, the change will go into effect in 24 hours.

You can also turn access to the dashboard on or off for individual users  or groups using Microsoft Entra ID.

In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home?#/viva/insights):  

1. Go to the **Settings** tab and select **Setup**. You need to enter your credentials if you're not already signed in.  

2. At the top, select **Set up and manage settings**. 

3. Under **Microsoft Copilot Dashboard**, select **Manage access settings for Microsoft Copilot Dashboard**.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/copilot-dash-admin-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to access the Copilot Dashboard settings.":::

**To enable access for new individual users:**

1. At the top, select **Users**. Search for the people you'd like to add, and select them from the list.

2. At the bottom, select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../org-team-insights/images/copilot-dashboard-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add new users.":::

**To enable access for new groups:**

1. At the top, select **Groups**. Search for the Entra ID groups you'd like to add, and select them from the list. 

2. At the bottom, select **Add**.

**To disable access for existing report users:**

1. To remove access for individual users, at the top, select **Users**. To remove access for entire Entra ID groups, select **Groups**.

2. Select the users or groups from the list for whom you'd like to remove access.

3. Select **Remove selected users** or **Remove selected groups**.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/copilot-dash-admin-settings-remove.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to remove users.":::

**Delegate access to the dashboard:**

If you have access to the dashboard, you can also delegate access to the dashboard to other people in your company. [Learn how](../../org-team-insights/delegate-access.md).

>[!Note]
>Employees can view the dashboard in the Viva Insights Teams or web app. To install the Teams app, please use [these instructions](../../advanced/setup-maint/setup-overview.md) (it is on by default).

## Remove access to the dashboard for the entire tenant with Powershell

These steps must be performed by the Microsoft 365 global admin.

You can set a policy to disable the dashboard for the tenant using Powershell cmdlets. This is a tenant-level policy, not a user, or group-level policy. No users are able to access the dashboard until you remove or update the policy, even if they were added in the Microsoft 365 admin center using the process above. Before you can use the cmdlet, you need to install a module and sign in to be authenticated. [Learn more about how to set these policies](/viva/feature-access-management).

1. [Connect to Exchange Online](/Viva/insights/advanced/setup-maint/configure-personal-insights#connect-to-exchange-online) and, when prompted, sign in with your admin credentials.
1. After you've signed in, you can manage access for your tenant using the Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet: [Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/add-vivamodulefeaturepolicy).

   **Example: Turn off the dashboard for all users in your tenant**

   ```powershell
    ModuleId : VivaInsights
    FeatureId : CopilotDashboard
    Name : DisableFeatureForAll
    IsFeatureEnabled : false
    Everyone
   ```
## Turn off dashboard auto-enablement with Powershell 

These steps must be performed by the Microsoft 365 global admin.

This feature access control allows Global admins to enable or disable the auto-enablement feature for the Copilot Dashboard in their tenant. This control supports tenant-level policies only, not user or group-level policies. You can set tenant polices using PowerShell cmdlets. Learn more about how to set these policies. [Learn more about how to set these policies](/viva/feature-access-management).

* **Default state**: Enabled, meaning that eligible users will be auto-enabled for access to the dashboard based on the identification criteria.

* **Disable or enable**: Admins can disable the dashboard auto-enablement control for their entire tenant using PowerShell cmdlets. Disabling the control prevents any user from getting auto-enabled for access to the dashboard.

    >[!Note]
    >User- and group-level policies aren't supported for this feature and will not take effect if used.

1. [Connect to Exchange Online](/Viva/insights/advanced/setup-maint/configure-personal-insights#connect-to-exchange-online) and, when prompted, sign in with your admin credentials.

1. After you’ve signed in, you can manage access for your tenant using the Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet: [Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/add-vivamodulefeaturepolicy).

   **Example: Turn off dashboard auto-enablement for your tenant**

   ```powershell
    ModuleId : VivaInsights
    FeatureId : AutoCxoIdentification
    Name : DisableFeatureForAll
    IsFeatureEnabled : false
    Everyone
   ```

## Upload organizational data 

### For Viva Insights customers 

These steps apply to Viva Insights admins.

>[!Note]
>This data upload process will go into effect within seven days.

If your company has Viva Insights licenses, your Insights admin can continue to upload organizational data through the advanced Insights app as explained [here](../admin/org-data-overview.md). Your global admin may choose to upload more organizational attributes through the Microsoft 365 admin center using [these steps](/viva/organizational-data).

There are two ways you can upload Organizational data:

1. Your Viva Insights admin can upload data through the advanced insights app using [these steps](../admin/org-data-overview.md). This is the recommended way to upload data if you have Viva Insights.  

    * [Learn more about data quality in the advanced insights app](../admin/org-data-overview.md#organizational-data-in-the-advanced-insights-app).
    * To avoid more delays on data showing in the dashboard, the Insights admin should include **EffectiveDate** fields and set the date earlier than the upload date. [Learn more](../admin/prepare-org-data.md).

2. Your Microsoft 365 Global admin can upload data through the admin center using [these steps](/viva/organizational-data).

   If the Viva Insights admin and Global admin *both* upload data, the dashboard displays insights based on the merge of the uploads and show data based on the more recent upload. The uploaded .csv file should include the required attributes shown below, otherwise the data won't show in the dashboard.

   Below are the attributes that are used in the Copilot Dashboard. Your admin should use the exact same attribute names as below when uploading correspondingly.

   | Attribute names for organizational data in Viva Insights | Attribute names for organizational data in Microsoft 365 | Required or optional for Copilot Dashboard |
   |----|----|----|
   | PersonId | Microsoft_PersonEmail | Required |
   | ManagerId | Microsoft_ManagerEmail | Required |
   | Organization | Microsoft_Organization | Required |
   | FunctionType | Microsoft_JobDiscipline | Optional. The “Job function” filter in the dashboard will be available if this attribute is uploaded. |

### For Copilot customers

This process applies to the Microsoft 365 global admin.

>[!Note]
>This data upload process will go into effect within seven days.

If your company has Copilot licenses but not Viva Insights licenses, you can upload organizational data through the Microsoft 365 admin center using [these steps](/viva/organizational-data).

Below are the attributes used in the dashboard. The admin should use the exact same attribute names as below when uploading the data.

| Attribute names for organizational Data in Microsoft 365  | Required or optional for Copilot Dashboard |
|---|---|
| Microsoft_PersonEmail | Required |
| Microsoft_ManagerEmail | Required |
| Microsoft_Organization | Required |
| Microsoft_JobDiscipline | Optional. The “Job function” filter in the dashboard will be available if this attribute is uploaded.  |

## Upload aggregated survey results

This process applies to the Microsoft 365 global admin.

You can also upload aggregated survey responses to enable a summary view of Copilot sentiment for the entire company. [Learn how using these steps](/microsoft-365/admin/adoption/ai-assistance). If you use this upload method, filters and heat maps are *not* supported. Filters and heat maps are only available to customers with a Viva Insights license.

>[!Note]
>If you upload survey data both as a .csv file *and* as aggregated results through the Microsoft 365 admin center, only the .csv survey results are shown in the dashboard. If you subsequently delete the .csv data, then the aggregated results are shown in the dashboard.

## Set minimum group size 

These steps apply both to Microsoft 365 global admins and Viva Insights admins.

>[!Note]
>This change will go into effect in 24 hours. This will be used for the metric comparison between groups in the Copilot Dashboard.

The dashboard's adoption and impact pages provide group-level metrics for groups that meet or exceed the minimum group size you set, which by default is 10 employees.

If your tenant does *not* have a Viva Insights license and you're a global admin, use these steps to set the minimum group size:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to the **Settings** tab and select **Microsoft Viva**, then **Microsoft Viva Insights**. 

2. Under **Copilot Dashboard in Microsoft 365**, select **Manage minimum group size**. 

3. Enter your preferred minimum group size, which must be at least five, then select **Save**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../images/min-group-size-admin.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows admins how to set the minimum group size.":::

    Or, if your tenant has a Viva Insights license and you're a Viva Insights admin, [use these steps to change the minimum group size](../../advanced/setup-maint/privacy-settings.md).  

## Create an exclusion list (hide users from aggregates)

This process applies to Microsoft 365 global admins.

>[!Important]
>If you don’t create an exclusion list, *all* employees who either have a Copilot license, a Viva Insights license, or are uploaded manually using the Cohort upload feature in the admin center, are included in the Copilot Dashboard’s insights. Any previous exclusions made in the analyst workbench do *not* apply to this feature. Any user exclusions you make with this feature do not apply elsewhere in Viva Insights or the analyst workbench.

>[!Note]
>When you upload an exclusion list, the process could take up to five days to run and complete. This means that users won’t be immediately excluded after the list is uploaded.

Your organization might want to exclude certain users from being included in the aggregated insights in the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard for various reasons, such as legal, compliance, or ethical concerns.

The user exclusion list allows Global admins to specify which employees' data should not be shown in the dashboard. You can exclude employees individually using a .csv file, or you can exclude groups of people using Microsoft Entra ID.

You can access this feature in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com) using these steps: 


1. Go to the **Settings** tab and select **Microsoft Viva**, then **Microsoft Viva Insights**. 

2. Select **Exclusion list for the Copilot in Microsoft 365 Dashboard**. 

3. To upload excluded users individually with a .csv file, select **Add users from CSV file**. To upload or remove excluded users with Microsoft Entra ID, select **Add or remove Entra groups**. Or, to overwrite an existing list of excluded users with a different set of users, select **Replace all existing users with new import**, and select either the .csv file or Microsoft Entra ID method.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/cdb-exclusion-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to upload users with the exclusion list feature.":::

### To upload or remove excluded users with a .csv file:

1. To upload a list of users, upload a .csv file that contains the “PersonId” of the users you want to include in the cohort analysis. The “PersonId” is a unique identifier for the employee record. It can be an employee's primary SMTP address or email alias. For example, person.name@xyz.com. For guidance, you can download a template for the .csv file from the admin center.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/exclusion-list-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to upload a csv file for the exclusion list.":::

2. Validate the list of users: Before you upload the list, you can validate the data to ensure that it’s accurate and compliant with the formatting rules. The validation checks for errors such as missing or invalid attributes, duplicate or conflicting records, or unsupported characters. The validation results show the number of errors, warnings, and successful records, and the results allow you to download a detailed report or fix the errors in the file. 

3. Confirm the list of users: After you upload the list, you can confirm the data and view a summary of the upload status, such as the number of users added, removed, or updated, the upload mode, and the upload date and time. The confirmation also shows a sample of the uploaded data and allows you to download the full list or undo the upload.

### To upload or remove excluded groups with Microsoft Entra ID:

Select **Add or remove Entra groups**. 

To add groups, search for the Entra ID group you’d like to add, and select it from the list. Then at the bottom, select **Add**.

:::image type="content" source="../images/cdb-exclusion-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to upload excluded users with Microsoft Entra ID.":::

To remove existing excluded groups, select the groups from the list for whom you’d like to remove access. Then select **Remove selected groups**.  

To overwrite your existing list of excluded users and add a new group of excluded users with Microsoft Entra ID, select **Replace all existing users with new import**, then select **Using Entra ID**. Follow the same steps above for adding new groups.

>[!Note]
>After you remove users with an exclusion list, it will take up to 96 hours for the changes to take effect.
