# Administrator scenarios for Answers in Viva Engage

Administration of Answers requires either an Engage admin or Answers admin role.

>[!NOTE]
>The Microsoft 365 Global administrator can designate an Answers admin by [adding a Knowledge manager in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Froles%2Fcontext%2Fugr-context). Knowledge managers are Answers admins and have elevated permissions over end users. For more information, see [Manage admin roles in Viva Engage](/Viva/engage/eac-key-admin-roles-permissions).

## Update information panel

### Provide guidance using the information panel

The Answers admin or Engage admin can use the information panel to provide guidance to employees on how to use Answers within the organization. By default, the information panel is only visible to administrators. After an admin saves and publishes the information panel, all other employees with access to Answers can see the information panel.

## Manage topics in Answers

Use topics to organize and curate Engage knowledge. Answers topics also help you stay on top of new questions about topics you follow or subscribe to. [Learn more about using topics in Viva Engage](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-topics-and-hashtags-in-viva-engage-98c0a0bb-aad0-45d3-88f1-4f6d12bb1772). 

>[!NOTE]
>Viva Topics will be retired in 2025. As part of that change, Viva Engage returns to a simplified topics experience and won't use Viva Topics or Lightweight Topics. During this transition, topics in Engage will be migrated to see the latest topics experience with the enablement of Answers and deletion of topics. Migrations are planned to complete in Spring 2025. Learn more about [Setting up Answers](/Viva/engage/eac-answers-overview-set-up#technical-requirements), and the [Viva Topics retirement](/microsoft-365/topics/changes-coming-to-topics?view=o365-worldwide&amp&preserve-view=true;WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-9501). 

## Bulk Remove topics

To remove a topic or multiple topics at once, applicable admins can:

1. Go to the Discover more topics page in Answers. 
2. Search by topic name, or filter by "All" to browse topics.  
3. Select the ellipsis icon on a topic to show edit and remove topics. 
4. Use the check box to select multiple topics to delete. 
5. When you remove the topic, the topic and all applications of the topic are removed. This action can't be undone.

## View Global Answers analytics

As an Answers admin, you can access Global Answers analytics:
1. Select the analytics icon from the top navigation bar of Viva Engage.
1. Go to the **Global Answers analytics** tab. The analytics dashboard provides an overview and relevant insights about knowledge sharing activity across Answers in Viva.

For more information about how to manage analytics in the [Viva Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-overview), see [View and manage analytics in Viva Engage](/Viva/engage/analytics).
