# Export data

As a pulse admin, you can choose to either export out all pulse data or specific report data. To access the Viva Pulse admin export feature, you must have one of the following admin roles assigned to you: Microsoft 365 Global admin, Pulse admin. Reports will get data only for reports created after enabling e-Discovery for Forms Responses. Otherwise, it will be empty.

To open the **Export** tab, go to Viva Pulse on the app or on the web, and select **Manage** and then **Data export**. Note that your tenant can only have one export job active at a time.

### Export all tenant data

To export out all data from a tenant, select **Create an export request** and then select all data. You must input a date range that can be no longer than one year. After inputting your desired dates, select **Export to .csv**.

You get an email notification letting you know when your export job is complete.

### Export report data

To export out report data from a tenant, select **Create an export request** and then select **Report data**. You must input a specific author and you can filter by pulse name and template type. After selecting your desired reports, select **Export to .csv**.
