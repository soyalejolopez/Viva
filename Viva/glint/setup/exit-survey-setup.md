# Set up a Viva Glint Exit survey

Together, Microsoft Viva Glint refers to Onboarding and Exit surveys as Employee Lifecycle surveys. Viva Glint **Exit surveys** help organizations understand the reasons that employees voluntarily leave. These reasons can range from career advancement opportunities elsewhere to dissatisfaction with their work environment.

## Recommended cadence and tips for Exit surveys

Send Exit surveys for voluntary terminations as soon as possible so that users can access survey invites from their work email address. 

- Exit survey Distribution List date ranges are relative to the termination date that your organization includes in data uploaded to Viva Glint.
- Choose to have Exit Surveys go to a company email or both a company and personal email.
  - If you use **Company Email Address**, set the date range from **14 days before the Termination Date to 1 day after.**
  - If you use **Company email + Personal email**, set the date range from **14 days before termination date to 30 days after.**
 
Learn more about using [date-based Distribution Lists](set-up-distribution-lists.md#use-date-based-lists).

### Survey access methods

If your organization plans to [include inactive users](set-up-distribution-lists.md#use-attribute-rules-to-add-users) in Exit Distribution Lists, use survey access methods that allow inactive users to respond to surveys:

1. [Attribute-based access](attribute-based-survey-access.md)
2. [Personalized link](understand-survey-access-methods.md#personalized-survey-link)
