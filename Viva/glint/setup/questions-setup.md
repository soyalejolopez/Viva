# Viva Glint Questions setup

As a Microsoft Viva Glint Administrator, use the Questions section to manage survey items, modify introduction and thank you messages, and add optional features like targeting, display logic, and sections. To set up survey items, use information from your [Holistic Vision and Strategy Discovery Workbook](customize-program.md#use-the-holistic-listening-vision-and-strategy-discovery-workbook) and your [Deployment guide survey tab](/viva/glint/introduction-viva-glint#deploy-viva-glint-and-launch-a-survey) as a guide.

> [!NOTE]
> The term **item** refers to any *question or statement* posed to a survey taker.

## Edit the survey introduction message

Customize the introduction message for the survey by hovering over and selecting the **Hello** message. In the **Edit Survey Intro** pane:

1. Edit **Greeting**: "Hello" is prepopulated but can be customized.
1. Edit **Text**: Default text shows in the **Text** box. All default text can be edited. Delete macros or add macros by selecting the **+ symbol**.
1. If the survey uses multiple languages, choose each language from the **Language** dropdown menu to edit translations. Changes autosave when a new language is selected from the dropdown menu.
1. Select **Save Changes** when all edits are complete.

To add a link to an employee resource or other information in your survey introduction:

1. Select the **Questions** section of your survey program and select the survey introduction section.

## Add survey questions

In programs that use survey templates, like Quarterly Engagement, the Questions section is prepopulated with survey items. There are two ways to access the Question library pane to add questions to a survey:

1. Select the **+** symbol that appears above the Thank you message after the last survey question, or
2. Select the **+** symbol next to the Thank you message and select the **Browse Questions** menu option.
   1. To prefilter questions based on type, choose Add Rating Question, Add Multiple Choice Question, or Add Open-Ended Question from the menu.
3. Use the **Search for a question** field to enter keywords to search for an item in the Question library edit pane.
4. Use the Sources, Type, Benchmark, and the More Filters options to filter to items based on your survey needs.
5. To add an item to the survey, hover over it and select the **+** symbol.

> [!TIP]
> For open-ended questions, consider whether [**Auto-expand comments input**](/../../viva/glint/setup/program-summary-overview) is enabled in **Program Setup**.

> [!NOTE]
> For Recurring surveys: 
> - Choose survey items for each cycle by selecting the cycle number next to the item. Cycle one (1) is the upcoming survey that launches on the date selected in the **Send the next survey on** field in the survey **Schedule**.
> - To be able to save the Questions section, every cycle needs to have at least one question selected.

## Create a custom question

When creating **new custom questions**, keep in mind that:

- There are no preloaded translations.
- There are no external benchmarks. [Learn more about mapping custom questions to benchmarks](custom-question-benchmark.md).
- Custom questions aren't included in the [Attrition Risk Index](/viva/glint/reports/alerts-report-attrition-risk#attrition-risk-index).
- Custom questions aren't mapped to standard [Action Plan Templates](/viva/glint/setup/customize-action-plans#understand-terminology-associated-with-content-resources-and-action-plans) or recommended [Focus Areas](/viva/glint/people-science/people-science-explains-focus-areas).
   
> [!CAUTION]
> Your organization may have policies governing appropriate survey items for employees. Ensure you consult any such policies before proceeding. Rather than create a new item, search the Question Library for existing questions that could be reused or repurposed. Viva Glint standard questions are validated and typically come with benchmarks and action plans. 

1. Select the **+** symbol at before the Thank you message to open the **Question library** edit pane.
2. Select the **+ Create** button. A **Create Question** window opens.
   1. You can also select an existing question to access the **Edit Question** pane and choose **Duplicate question** create a custom copy of a Viva Glint item.
1. For your new item, enter information in [editable fields](#editable-question-fields).              
1. If your survey uses multiple languages, select each language from the **Language** dropdown menu to update translations. Changes autosave when a new language is selected from the dropdown menu.
1. Select **Save and Add**.

## Edit survey questions

Before **editing** an item:

- Select the item and check whether it exists in other surveys in the Associated Programs tab.
- [Review the impact of editing Viva Glint standard items](question-library.md#the-implication-of-customizing-editing-question-library-items).

To edit a survey item in the Questions section:

1. Hover over the item to display the horizontal ellipsis.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/questions-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dropdown menu next to survey items.":::

1. Select **Edit Question** from the ellipsis dropdown menu.
1. In the **Edit Question** pane, change information in [editable fields](#editable-question-fields).               
1. If your survey uses multiple languages, select each language from the **Language** dropdown menu to update translations. Changes autosave when a new language is selected from the dropdown menu.
1. Select **Save changes**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Open-Ended questions are always optional and don't include an "Optional question" setting.
> - To add a new response option to Multiple Choice/Multi-Select questions, always use the "+ Add new choice" feature. Switch the "Show" toggle to "Hide" to retire an option. Overwriting an existing option with a different/new label causes trend issues in reports and confusion in raw data exports.
