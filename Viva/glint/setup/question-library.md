# Find validated items in the Viva Glint Question Library

The Microsoft Viva Glint Question Library contains hundreds of questions and statements (called *items*) that can be included in your surveys. If you choose a template for a specific survey type, the questions and statements that best support the survey goal are prepopulated in the template. You can create and edit items from the Question Library, but Viva Glint suggests using our standard questions as most are mapped to benchmarks.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all items in the Question Library are posed in question format. Many library items are statements for the survey taker to rate on a given scale. For this reason, the term "items" is often used to refer to the contents of the Question Library.

## There are two versions of some Viva Glint standard Question Library items

Some Viva Glint standard items (questions) have two versions.

- Standard items: items validated by People Science that are mapped to benchmarks using *exact* text for recurring, Engagement-type programs.
- Standard items for Employee Lifecycle (Onboarding and Exit) programs: items validated by People Science that are mapped to benchmarks using text specific to Employee Lifecycle programs.
  - Using the search bar, enter "Onboarding" or "Exit" to bring up the items for Employee Lifecycle programs.

## Uses for the Question Library 
- Search items by question type, key driver, benchmark, and whether translations are available 
- Import and export questions for language translations 
- Edit or create questions 
- Sort by Viva Glint standard questions or a custom question you created or edited 
- View the number of your programs that use this item

> [!NOTE]
>  - When a reporting (item) label is changed, it instantly propagates to all programs, past and present.
>  - When question text is changed, it propagates to future programs only.

## The implication of customizing (editing) Question Library items 

Viva Glint has extensive research that identifies the most reliable and valid items linked to survey goals. Our benchmarks are created using the *exact* text from these items. Even a slight change to a question or statement can alter the meaning enough to invalidate a comparison to the benchmark.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > In cases where text changes alter the item's meaning, the benchmark comparison is no longer valid, and the items is now "customized," not "standard."
   > - For these items, create a copy of the standard item so that it isn't tied to an invalid benchmark for comparison.
   > - Customized items don't map to external benchmarks by default. Carefully review [Question mapping](/../../viva/glint/setup/question-mapping) information before [linking a custom question to an external benchmark suite](custom-question-benchmark.md).

## Edit items from the Question Library 

Any item can be edited by hovering over and selecting the row that the item appears on in the Question Library. An **Edit Question** panel displays. From this panel, edit the item and view programs that use this item.

1. Choose the language. Available languages are visible in the dropdown menu. 
1. Edit the reporting label, if desired. 
1. Edit the item text, if desired.
1. Review [Question mapping](/../../viva/glint/setup/question-mapping) information before [linking a custom question to an external benchmark suite](custom-question-benchmark.md) in the Benchmark field.
1. Add instruction text that helps the user understand the meaning of the item. 
1. Add comment placeholder text, if desired. 
1. Change the rating scale, if applicable. 
1. Indicate whether the rating label explanation should be shown. 
1. Enable or disable commenting. 
1. Choose whether the item is optional or mandatory.
1. Map the item to a Suggested Action Template, if desired. 
1. Select **Save Changes**. 

### Examples of edits that retain a valid benchmark comparison

There may be cases where slight edits to wording can be accommodated without altering the meaning. In these cases, benchmark data is retained.  

|Example|Standard|Modified|Recommendation|
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
|**1 - Matching the language of the business**| I would recommend my *manager* to others.|I would recommend my *supervisor* to others.| Modifying a term in the item to make it more specific to your organizational language is acceptable and doesn't affect the benchmark. To retain the benchmark, edit the standard item without creating a copy.| 
|**2 - Using synonyms**|The recruitment process was *excellent*.|The recruitment process was *great*.|If the replacement word is likely to be interpreted similarly, the item change is acceptable. To retain the benchmark, edit the standard item without creating a copy.|

### Examples of edits that don't retain a valid benchmark comparison

| Example | Standard | Modified | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| **1 - Altering the subject** | *I feel empowered* to make decisions regarding my work. | *My manager empowers me* to make decisions regarding my work. |  Altering the subject in an item changes the way people respond, and the benchmark is longer valid. Create a copy of the standard item and customize the copy so that there isn't an invalid benchmark tied to the edited item. |
| **2 - Altering the subject** | My manager *provides me with feedback that helps me improve my performance*. | My manager and *I have regular conversations*. | When the meaning of an item is completely changed, the change isn't recommended, and the benchmark is no longer valid. Create a copy of the standard item and customize the copy so that there isn't an invalid benchmark tied to the edited item. |

## View associated programs 

Use this tab to see if an item is being used with any existing program. To add it to a program, use the [Questions page in Program Summary](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231415). 

English is the default language for all Viva Glint programs. When possible, survey and communicate to your employees in their preferred language. Viva Glint provides its customers with more than many language translations for standard content. Language translations are set during the initial survey configuration in [General Settings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230744) or added later, as needed. 

## Add new items to the Question Library 

Select the **+ Create Question** button on the **Question Library** page. In the **Create Question** panel, edit the question. Upon completion, you see new item in the **Name** column, sorted alphabetically by key driver.
