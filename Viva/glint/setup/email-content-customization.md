# Customize Viva Glint survey email content

Customize Microsoft Viva Glint email content for survey invites, reminders, and survey results notifications in the Communications section of Program Setup. Optionally, set up a custom email sending domain and a company logo for survey emails. To understand how to enable/disable emails, and for more information about Communications setup, see [Communications setup in Program Summary](program-summary-communications.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always-On survey programs don't have a Communications section for setup.

## Custom sending domains and themes/logos (optional)

In the [Microsoft Admin Center (MAC)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264234), your M365 admin can optionally configure a custom sending domain for your organization. In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/#home), customize your organization's branding to include your logo in survey communications:

- [Set up a custom sending domain](/microsoft-365/admin/email/select-domain-to-use-for-email-from-microsoft-365-products)
- [Customize company branding](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding)
  - To add your organization's logo to Viva Glint survey emails, set up the **Sign-in form** > **Banner logo** in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

Both items are *optional steps* that your organization can take to further customize the survey communication experience for your survey participants.

> [!NOTE]
> - Custom sending domains configured in MAC can impact other M365 products. See [Set up a custom sending domain](/microsoft-365/admin/email/select-domain-to-use-for-email-from-microsoft-365-products) for a full list.
> - Viva Glint teams have access to limited email delivery metrics. Using a custom sender domain gives your organization direct access to your email delivery data.
> - [Send an email preview](#preview-emails) to see your organization's customized logo. The preview in the email setup pane in the platform always displays the Viva Glint logo. 

## Email sections

To edit email content, go to the **Communications** section of **Program Summary** in your desired survey program. Select the **pencil icon** to edit a communication. In the edit panel that appears, select the **pencil icon** to edit content. Glint survey invites and reminders contain multiple editable sections:

Add your customizations to each section and select **Save Changes**.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Hyperlinks and HTML aren't supported content in Glint customized emails. These items can cause email delivery or blocking issues.
> - Glint Admins can add links as plain text; for example: `www.microsoft.com`.
>   - Some versions of Microsoft Outlook automatically convert a plain text link into a clickable link. To prevent creating issues with links, ensure that the plain text URL is less than or equal to 100 characters, or create a shortened link.

### Email macros

Macros in Viva Glint emails allow your organization to add placeholders that pull in information from your employee data and from Glint. Customize your message by including Departments, Manager Names, or the estimated to complete a survey in email. To add a macro, select the **plus sign icon** in each email sections and choose a macro from the dropdown menu.

## Manage language translations

Any edits made to email text in English need to be made to all other survey languages.

In the email edit panel, after customizing English content, use the **Language** dropdown menu to select other survey languages and add translations to each survey section. Select **Save Changes** in the top right to save all of your edits.

### Use the program content import

Use this [translation guidance](language-translations.md) to import updated translations for emails after modifying English text.

## Survey End Results Notification email

The Survey End Results Notification email is designed to notify managers that their results are ready for review in Viva Glint dashboards. It contains several sections, including some that link to more resources. 

Sections that can be easily customized: Button Text, Greeting, Main Title, Preview Text, Subject Title, Tip Titles, Tip Descriptions

**Avoid customizing links and icons**.

These results notification email sections support multiple paragraphs to break up and emphasize important text:
- Description
- Main Title
- Tip 1 Description
- Tip 2 Description
- Tip 3 Description
