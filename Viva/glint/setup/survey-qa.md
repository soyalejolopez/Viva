# Review and test Viva Glint surveys before launch

To prepare for a smooth launch for your Microsoft Viva Glint survey programs, use the guidance and checklists available here to confirm that all platform and survey settings are correct.

## Confirm selections in General settings

Selections that admins make in [General settings](manage-general-settings.md) lay the groundwork for users' survey-taking and reporting experiences. Verify that your choices for important fields here appear as expected.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all General settings fields are included here, but settings that have the biggest impact to survey takers are included.

|Section  |Item  |Confirm that...|

## Review confidentiality settings

Viva Glint confidentiality settings determine the level of privacy users expect when responding to surveys and what managers can view in reports when survey results are available. Confirm the survey's confidentiality settings in **[Advanced configuration](understand-advanced-configuration.md)** for:

- [Rated question scores](manage-confidentiality-thresholds.md#rated-question-scores)
- [Response rates](manage-confidentiality-thresholds.md#response-rates)
- [Comments](manage-confidentiality-thresholds.md#comments)

Learn more about [managing thresholds at the survey level](manage-confidentiality-thresholds.md#survey-thresholds).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Viva Glint Admins can't change confidentiality settings after a survey launches. Select and confirm thresholds before enabling a survey.**

## Review survey setup

Review each section of your survey program setup before launching a test survey to an internal team. For information on settings that Viva Glint Admins can edit while a survey is live, see: [Make changes to a live Viva Glint survey](change-live-survey.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Preview data in reporting

After reviewing your survey setup and confirming that employee data is imported to Viva Glint, use the [Generate Report Preview](preview-demo-reporting.md) option to preview how attributes and questions look in reports.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Generate Report Preview option is only available for Recurring and Ad Hoc survey types.

## Launch a test survey

To verify your Viva Glint survey setup, launch a test survey, collect feedback, make updates, and delete the test survey after testing is complete. 

### Select a group of survey testers

At least two to three weeks before launching your first Viva Glint survey, conduct testing with a group of users on your project team. Include your Viva Glint core project team and any stakeholders who should provide approval for the survey. For complex setups and surveys with multiple translations, involve testers who can validate all languages selected.

Each test user can review the survey experience with this checklist: [Review a Viva Glint test survey](survey-testing.md).

Provide instructions for users on items that you want them to focus on, including:

- email invite and reminder delivery days and times
- attribute-based access survey link experience (provide link, if applicable)
- languages they should review (if applicable)
- question targeting they should confirm (if applicable)
- question display logic (if applicable)

### Set up a test survey

Launch a test survey to your project team to confirm that emails arrive and the survey-taking experience appears as expected. To set up a test survey:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To launch a test survey, always create a copy of your survey program. Viva Glint Admins can delete test survey programs, but not test survey cycles in a survey program.

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configuration** and then choose **Survey Programs**.
1. On the far right of your completed survey program, select the ellipses and choose **Duplicate** from the menu that appears.
1. A new survey program appears titled **"survey name" Copy**.
1. Select the copied survey and go to **Distribution**.
   1. Select a Distribution List that includes test users in the **Distribution For This Program** field.
1. Select **Save & Continue** to go to **Schedule**.
   1. Select a date to launch your test survey in the **Send the next survey on** field.
   1. Select the number of days the test survey is open in the **Response Window** field.
1. Go to the **Communications** section to confirm timing and invites/reminders are selected for your test survey's **Response Window**.
1. Approve and enable your test survey:
   - [Approve and enable Recurring and Ad Hoc surveys](preview-manage-enable-engage-programs.md)
   - [Approve and enable Lifecycle and Always-On surveys](preview-filter-lifecycle-programs.md)
4. Collect feedback from survey testers and update your survey setup based on feedback.

### Capture survey tester feedback

Use this template to create a log to track and resolve survey tester feedback. The first row is populated with an example.

| Issue category |Issue | Description | Tester | Date logged | Status | Resolution |
|:----------|:-----------|:------------|:----------|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| Email | Email went to junk | Viva Glint survey invite went to Junk folder instead of inbox | Test User | January 13, 2025 | Resolved | Worked with IT to update allowlist |

### Delete a test survey

When survey testing is complete, [delete your test survey](delete-survey-data.md) from **Survey Programs**.

## Approve and enable a survey for launch

After all testing and review are complete, [Approve and Enable](preview-manage-enable-engage-programs.md) your survey for launch.
