# Release feedback results to User Roles

To determine when leaders get access to Recurring or Ad Hoc survey results, grant Live or Phased access to User Roles. Access status can't be switched while a survey is live.

- **Live access**: Reporting access is readily available, in real time, as surveys are completed. Admins always have *Live* access and can't be included in *Phased* access rollout.
  
- **Phased access**:  Recommended for managers and HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners) for action planning, tracking, and reviewing feedback results for completed surveys.
  - Excludes this role group from real-time, live survey results
  - Is configured at the program level but occurs at the cycle level
  - Allows users access to historical cycles
  - Prohibits reporting access during that cycle until the survey ends and the admin grants access 

> [!TIP]
> Keep survey results classified while the survey is *Live*, among just a small group of leaders. Incomplete results may lead to unintended and inaccurate conclusions. Feedback results aren't final until all results are considered.
 
## Grant user access for a completed cycle

1. Switch to the **Completed** view and hover over the survey cycle. 
2. In the **Reporting view** column for the desired survey, view reporting access. In this example, the **Reporting view** shows that *7 of 8 Roles* currently see reports and by hovering over the hyperlink, the User Roles with their current access display. The hyperlink could indicate *Fully Released**.

3. Now select the hyperlink in the **Reporting view** column and then select **Grant Access**.

4. In the **Grant Report Access**, check the box of any role that requires access. Once access is granted, it can't be revoked.
5. Select **Provide Access**.

6. Now the **Reporting view** column for this survey reads *Fully Released* and is visible to all roles with permissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When a new program cycle begins, reporting from the previous cycle is automatically released to all users with permissions to see the results. This release occurs even when the admin hasn't updated all roles to **Live** status.
