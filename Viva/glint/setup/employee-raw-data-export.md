# Access Viva Glint raw survey responses

In Microsoft Viva Glint, "raw survey responses" refers to unaggregated survey responses that are directly tied to a survey taker. 

## Who has access to raw survey responses?

By default, Viva Glint’s in-product reporting doesn't include raw survey responses and is reported in the aggregate. However, your organization may choose to make some surveys “identifiable,” meaning survey responses are directly linked to the survey taker. If a survey is identifiable, survey takers are informed before taking the survey. Learn more about [Viva Glint confidentiality and reporting](viva-glint-survey-privacy.md).

While raw survey responses aren't included in Viva Glint default reporting, Viva Glint admins can export them unless export is disabled. Even when export of raw survey responses is disabled, your organization may still access raw survey responses if it determines that certain Extreme Circumstances exist. Learn more about [Extreme Circumstances](#exception-for-extreme-circumstances). 

## Configuring raw survey response export

By default, raw survey responses are exportable for each new survey program, but Viva Glint admins can opt out of raw survey response exports. When setting up each Viva Glint program, the Viva Glint admin decides whether raw survey response exports are available. 

Admins can configure the Export Raw Survey Responses control at any time during a survey program, but the change only applies to future survey cycles. Closed cycles permanently conform to the setting established when the cycle launches. So, if export was disabled when a survey cycle launched, enabling it later doesn't retroactively allow export of raw survey responses.

## Disabling export of raw survey responses permanently limits your access to this data

> [!CAUTION]
> Disabling export of raw survey responses means that:
> - Your organization permanently loses the ability to access these raw survey responses unless you determine that certain Extreme Circumstances exist. Learn more about the [Extreme Circumstances exception](raw-data-extreme-circumstances.md). 
> - If your organization leaves Viva Glint, you can't take raw survey responses with you.
> - You aren't able to (and Microsoft isn't able to facilitate) transfer of these raw survey responses to a third party, such as an alternative survey platform or data analytics consultant.  

## Exception for Extreme Circumstances

Even when export of raw survey responses is disabled, you can still identify a survey taker if your organization determines that Extreme Circumstances exist. 

### What do Extreme Circumstances mean? 

Extreme Circumstances exist if your organization feels that disclosure of a survey taker’s identity is necessary. Valid reasons are to investigate, prevent, or act regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations with potential threats to the safety of a person, or otherwise to comply with the law.

If your organization determines that Extreme Circumstances exist, make an Extreme Circumstances disclosure request, and Microsoft can identify the survey taker.

### Who determines whether Extreme Circumstances exist?

Your organization is solely responsible for determining whether Extreme Circumstances exist. Microsoft doesn't independently evaluate Extreme Circumstances disclosure requests. If your organization attests that Extreme Circumstances exist, Microsoft provides the requested identity of the survey taker.

[Learn how to make an Extreme Circumstances disclosure request](raw-data-extreme-circumstances.md).

## Responding to Data Subject Requests (DSRs) when export of raw survey responses is disabled

In some jurisdictions, Viva Glint users may have certain rights related to their personal data, including the rights to access, correct, delete, and restrict processing. Because raw survey responses are linked (or linkable) to identifiable survey takers, they're considered personal data. [Learn more about DSRs](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-data-subject-requests).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You may have multiple Viva Glint experiences in your tenant. As each experience operates independently, users' personal data may be distributed across multiple experiences. For this reason, users must request data deletion (DSRs) for each instance they're part of.

If you need to provide a survey taker with their raw survey responses to fulfill a DSR, you can do so even if export of this data is disabled. Viva Glint allows admins to send a survey taker’s raw survey responses directly to the survey taker without accessing or viewing this data. Learn how to [respond to DSRs in Viva Glint](raw-data-request-response.md).

## Configure raw survey response exports

By default, export of raw survey responses is enabled for each new Viva Glint survey program. However, the Viva Glint admin can disable export using a control in the Confidentiality section of Program Setup.

1.	Select **Survey Programs** in the **Survey** section.
2.	Select the survey and then **Program Setup** on the *Program Summary* page.
3.	Find the Confidentiality section of the Program Setup page.
4.	Here you find a control entitled **Enable Raw Survey Response Export**. 
5.	By default, the control is set to **YES**, meaning export is enabled.
6.	To disable export of raw survey responses, set the control to **NO**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't enable export of raw survey responses when a program is in Approved status. To enable raw survey response export, ensure Approved is set to NO. 

Opting out of response exports occurs within the **Confidentiality** section of *Program Setup*. Program Summary is accessible from the *Survey Programs* configuration page of the admin dashboard. 

1. Select **Survey Programs** in the **Survey** section.
1. Select the survey and then **Program Setup** on the *Program Summary* page.
2. The default setting for **Enable Export of Raw Survey Responses** is **YES**. Toggle to **NO** to opt out of raw survey response exports. [Read more about the confidentiality statement](viva-glint-survey-privacy.md).

## Raw survey response file layout and content

The fields included in Viva Glint raw survey response exports vary. Variation is based on the attributes that your organization sends, export selections, and the items included in your survey. These columns are always included, including a field for every survey item:

|Field Label  |Description   |Value Format|
|----------|-----------|------------|
|Survey Cycle Creation Date   |The date and time that surveys were generated for users.       |YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss|
|Survey Cycle Completion Date|The date and time a unique user completed the survey.    |YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss|
|Survey Cycle Title|The name of the survey cycle.  |\<Month> \<Year> \<Program name> Survey|
|ItemText1  |Full text of survey item or question UUID. |Numeric response value.|
|ItemText2  |Full text of survey item or question UUID. |Numeric response value.|
|ItemText3  |Full text of survey item or question UUID. |Numeric response value.|

### Partial, blank, and termed employee response handling

- Partially completed surveys that participants don't submit **aren't** included in raw response exports.
- Blank surveys with no question responses or comments **aren't** included in raw response exports.
- Surveys submitted by terminated employees **are** included in raw response exports. Consider your organization's [data deletion settings](manage-general-settings.md#user-data) and how they affect terminated employee response data.

> [!NOTE]
> - The export option is only available to admins.
> -	The export option is only enabled for a survey cycle if the raw survey response export is enabled before the survey went live.

> [!CAUTION]
> Once a survey is live, the choice to enable or disable raw survey response export can't be changed for that survey.
