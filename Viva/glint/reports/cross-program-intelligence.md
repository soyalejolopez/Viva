# Use Viva Glint cross-program intelligence to filter results across survey programs

Microsoft Viva Glint cross-program intelligence is an advanced filtering option in Viva Glint that allows users to filter across multiple surveys' results to answer your organization's complex employee sentiment questions. This feature can surface patterns across separate survey programs, giving leaders a holistic understanding of employee feedback. For a given survey program, users can filter by another survey program's:

- attribute values
- question responses
- comment topics and sentiment

> [!NOTE]
> To use cross-program intelligence, users need to be in a role with **Cross-Program Advanced Filtering** enabled in the role's **Permissions and Access** section.

## Confidentiality

Viva Glint’s cross-program intelligence always honors the stricter confidentiality threshold between two survey programs to always meet data protection expectations set with participants when they took the survey. 

With cross-program filtering, users can filter by attributes and demographics but also by question responses and comment sentiment and topics. To protect confidentiality in these analyses, there's always a baseline threshold of 10 respondents for scores and 20 for comments. 

## Example use cases

Your organization can use cross-program intelligence to explore topics like: 

- How employees rate their engagement after the first 90 days of onboarding.
- How different manager qualities might explain employee exit reasons.
- How employees rate their engagement depending on their Microsoft 365 Copilot usage.

> [!TIP]
> - **Survey results and filtering**: Ensure that you select the appropriate surveys to view results for and surveys to filter by. For example, to view exiting employees' reasons for leaving when their engagement scores are high, go to reports for an Exit survey and use Engagement question responses as filters.
>   
> - **Timeframes**: Select timeframes for surveys that are close enough to give good results. For example, if you select Exit survey results for July 2024, make sure that the survey that you use as a filter is for the same timeframe.

## How to filter with cross-program intelligence

Learn how a user can filter by another survey program's question responses using engagement ratings compared to Microsoft 365 Copilot usage as an example.

1. From the **Dashboard**, select **Reports**.
1. In the menu on the left, select the survey that you want to see results for. In this case, choose the Microsoft 365 Copilot Impact Survey to find out if more engaged employees have higher Copilot usage.  
1. Select the **Executive Summary Report** and select the filter pane at the top to expand it.
1. Select **Advanced** in the top right of the filter pane and choose **Yes, enable advanced filtering** in the dialog that appears.
